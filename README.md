## Hi there 👋 I'm David Jiang, check out my [website](https://xpoes123.github.io/davidJ)! 

I’m a Software Engineer **at Uncountable**, a YC-backed startup that builds a unified data platform for **R&D organizations**, chemists, materials scientists, formulation teams, and process engineers.  

I recently graduated (May 2025) from the **University of Wisconsin–Madison** with a degree in **Math and Computer Science**, after spending several years pursuing chemistry and biochemistry. 
Some of my favorite courses were *Arithmetic Algorithms, Programming Languages, Synthetic Organic Chemistry, Protein Motifs, Fractal Geometry,* and *Integer Partitions*.

## 🔭 What I’m Currently Building

### 🧪 **[SciBowl.org](https://github.com/xpoes123/scibowl-org) — A full Science Bowl training & competition platform**

A modern, web-based ecosystem designed for **students, coaches, and tournament organizers**.  
I'm building SciBowl.org to address long-standing gaps in the Science Bowl community:

- **Massive Question Database**  
  PDF → parsed → normalized → searchable, with category tags and difficulty metadata.

- **Team & Individual Practice Modes**  
  Short answer, multiple choice, and multi-select with clean UI and immediate feedback.

- **Real-Time Buzzing System**  
  Concurrency-safe scrimmaging.

- **Player Analytics & Insights**  
  Accuracy by category, speed distributions, long-term improvement tracking.

- **Coach Tools**  
  Rosters, custom practice sets, usage analytics.

*(Fully bootstrapped. Hoping to turn this into a long-term edtech platform.)*

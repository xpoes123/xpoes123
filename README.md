## Hi there 👋 I'm David (luckypro)

I'm a software engineer passionate about **machine learning**, **data-driven systems**, and building tools that help real communities.  
Right now, my main focus is creating the next major platform for **National Science Bowl** students, teams, and coaches.

---

### 🔭 What I’m Currently Working On
### **🧪 SciBowl.org — A full Science Bowl training & competition platform**
A modern, web-based ecosystem designed for students, coaches, and tournament organizers.  
I'm building SciBowl.org to solve long-standing problems in the Science Bowl community:

- **Massive Question Database**  
  PDF → parsed + cleaned + searchable question bank with filters, difficulty tagging, and category metadata.

- **Practice Mode for Teams & Individuals**  
  Short answer, multiple choice, multi-select modes — all synchronized with clean UI and instant feedback.

- **Real-Time Buzzing System**  
  Websocket-free, concurrency-safe buzzing for scrimmages and online practices.

- **Tournament Tools**  
  Bracket manager, scorekeeping tools, packet randomizer, and analytics dashboards for coaches.

- **Player Analytics & Insights**  
  Stats tracking, accuracy by category, response time histograms, and personalized training recommendations.

- **Coach Dashboard**  
  Manage rosters, assign custom practice sets, track improvement over time.

I want SciBowl.org to eventually support:
- Invitational hosting  
- Automatic packet generation  
- ELO-style player ratings  
- LLM-powered question explanation + tutoring

*(This project is fully bootstrapped and I’m building it with long-term edtech potential in mind.)*

### ⚡ Fun fact
I competed heavily in Science Bowl and now want to give back by building tools I wish existed when I was a student.

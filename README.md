I’m a **Forward Deployed Engineer at Ramp**, working close to customers to design, build, and ship solutions that integrate Ramp’s platform into real-world workflows. I love talking to customers and I love the startup space.

Previously, I was at **Uncountable**, a YC-backed startup building a data platform for R&D and materials science teams.

I graduated in **May 2025** from the **University of Wisconsin–Madison** with a degree in **Math and Computer Science**, after initially studying chemistry and biochemistry.

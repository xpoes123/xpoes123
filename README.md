I’m a **Forward Deployed Engineer at Ramp**, working primarily on making companies spend less money. Previously, I was at **Uncountable**, a YC-backed startup building a unified data platform for R&D, materials science, and chemistry teams.

I graduated in **May 2025** from the **University of Wisconsin–Madison** with a degree in **Math and Computer Science**, after initially studying chemistry and biochemistry. I tend to enjoy work that sits between theory and systems.

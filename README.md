## Hi there 👋 I'm David Jiang

I’m a Software Engineer on the **Integrations team at Uncountable**, a YC-backed startup that builds a unified data platform for **R&D organizations** — chemists, materials scientists, formulation teams, and process engineers.  

I recently graduated (May 2025) from the **University of Wisconsin–Madison** with a degree in **Math and Computer Science**, after spending several years pursuing chemistry and biochemistry. 

Some of my favorite courses were *Arithmetic Algorithms, Programming Languages, Fractal Geometry,* and *Integer Partitions*.

## 🔭 What I’m Currently Building

### 🧪 **SciBowl.org — A full Science Bowl training & competition platform**

A modern, web-based ecosystem designed for **students, coaches, and tournament organizers**.  
I'm building SciBowl.org to address long-standing gaps in the Science Bowl community:

- **Massive Question Database**  
  PDF → parsed → normalized → searchable, with category tags and difficulty metadata.

- **Team & Individual Practice Modes**  
  Short answer, multiple choice, and multi-select with clean UI and immediate feedback.

- **Real-Time Buzzing System**  
  Concurrency-safe scrimmaging — no websockets required.

- **Tournament Infrastructure**  
  Brackets, scorekeeping, timing tools, packet randomizers, and coach dashboards.

- **Player Analytics & Insights**  
  Accuracy by category, speed distributions, long-term improvement tracking.

- **Coach Tools**  
  Rosters, custom practice sets, usage analytics.

**Future goals include:**
- Invitational hosting  
- Automatic packet generation  
- ELO-style player ratings  
- LLM-powered question explanations and tutoring  

*(Fully bootstrapped. Hoping to turn this into a long-term edtech platform.)*

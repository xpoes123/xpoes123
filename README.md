## Hi there 👋 I'm David Jiang, check out my [website](https://xpoes123.github.io/davidJ)!

I'm a Software Engineer **at Uncountable**, a YC-backed startup that builds a unified data platform for **R&D organizations**, chemists, materials scientists, formulation teams, and process engineers.

I recently graduated (May 2025) from the **University of Wisconsin–Madison** with a degree in **Math and Computer Science**, after spending several years pursuing chemistry and biochemistry.
Some of my favorite courses were *Arithmetic Algorithms, Programming Languages, Synthetic Organic Chemistry, Protein Motifs, Fractal Geometry,* and *Integer Partitions*.

## 🔭 What I'm Currently Building

### 🧪 **[Scibowl.org](https://github.com/xpoes123/nsb-arena) — A Modern Science Bowl Tournament & Practice Platform**

A full-stack ecosystem designed for **students, coaches, and tournament organizers** in the National Science Bowl community.
Built with **React + TypeScript + Django + PostgreSQL**, containerized with Docker.

**What I'm building to modernize Science Bowl:**

- **Tournament Discovery & Management**
  Community-driven tournament listings with automated validation, slug-based routing, and detailed tournament pages. Tournament data managed via JSON files with GitHub Actions validation ensuring data quality.

- **MOSS (Moderator Platform)**
  Live game moderation system for judges with real-time buzz tracking. Captures exactly where players buzz in each question for enhanced post-tournament analytics.

- **Question Database & Practice Tools**
  Comprehensive question repository with PDF parsing, category tagging, and multiple practice modes (flashcards, reading mode, team scrimmages).

- **Tournament Analytics & Insights**
  Player performance tracking by category, buzz point analysis, accuracy distributions, and long-term improvement metrics. Helps coaches identify strengths and weaknesses.

**Key Technical Decisions:**
- JSON-based tournament data with automated schema validation via GitHub Actions
- Slug-based routing for clean, SEO-friendly URLs
- Progressive disclosure UX pattern (unified dashboard for all users, admin controls shown conditionally)
- Optional authentication (public viewing without login, enhanced features when authenticated)
- Docker-first development with multi-container orchestration
- Feature-based frontend architecture for scalability

**Recent milestones:**
- Migrated entire tournament system from ID-based to slug-based schema (25+ tournaments)
- Built automated validation pipeline blocking invalid data from merging
- Implemented drag-and-drop pool configuration with round-robin scheduling
- Set up Docker environment running both Website and MOSS frontends simultaneously
- Created comprehensive data models for tournaments, teams, coaches, players, rooms, and games

*(Fully bootstrapped. Building this as a long-term platform for the Science Bowl community.)*
